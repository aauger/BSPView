* TODO subpixel accurate rasterization
** TODO convert whole pipeline to use fixed point
*** TODO span buffer
*** TODO wall interpolation

* TODO performance 
** TODO draw two pixels at once where possible
*** TODO can this be combined with texturing? i don't know. 

* TODO texturing  
** TODO precompile 1 to 160 pixel unrolled loops that load and reuse each texel as much as possible
** TODO store the length of each "load_texel, n * use_texel" chunk for each size, use that for clipping and jumping to the right chunk
** TODO for lighting, use pre-lit textures?
