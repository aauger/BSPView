# Optimize performance
- backface culling in worldspace?
- check sector AABBs or spheres against frustum and span-buffer
- drawing horizontal rectangular regions horizontally?
- optimize vertex transformation with assembly?
- optimize span-buffer with assembly?
- optimize wall rasterization with assembly?
  
# texturing 
- slow accurate texturing is easy
- fast, inaccurate texturing is easy
- fast and accurate texturing. how?
- ideas: for light levels, use pre-lit textures?

# improvements 
- add yaw/looking up and down? (one extra multiply per vertex)
- add left-right scrolling to skybox (it's currently fixed in place) 
- add sprite objects
- add an automap
- make gameplay speed framerate independent?
